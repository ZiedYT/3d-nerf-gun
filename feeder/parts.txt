Micro controller - battery - DC motor controller should come from the blaster

A plastic container - connect it with the main unit to store the balls
JGB37-520 - Agitator dc motor (main component)
brushless motor - motor for the spinning fan
30A ESC brushless controller - controls the fan

While attaching the parts, make sure there is a perfect seal so you dont lose airflow! I use sponge cloths between the parts to make a seal.
